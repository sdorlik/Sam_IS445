        Welcome to my Website! This is a culmination of a semester's worth of work within ASP.Net. Within this website there contains Javascript, HTML, CSS, and C# code. The purpose of this site is to show case the various skills and tasks that I have learned throughout my course. Ultimately however no website is ever perfect and this is merely a work in progress. While there are many things that could be improved within the page however, it still has a basic template that could apply to many different senarios of future websites.
